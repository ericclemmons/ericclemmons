summary: How to install LTeX for VS Code
---

## Friction Log

1. Install [`ltex-ls`](https://github.com/valentjn/ltex-ls)

   ```shell
   brew install ltex-ls
   ```

2. Get path to `ltex-ls`

   ```shell
   readlink -f $(brew --prefix ltex-ls)
   # /opt/homebrew/Cellar/ltex-ls/15.2.0
   ```

3. Install [LTeX - LanguageTool grammar/spell checking VS Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valentjn.vscode-ltex)

4. Update [`ltex.ltex-ls.path`](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/settings.html#ltexltex-lspath) in VS Code's settings

5. Reset & Restart LTeX Extension

6. Test it out!

   I used the following text:

   ```
   This is an mistake.
   ```

   It can even fix it!

I'm **glad** I spent the hour installing & correcting things! This would've been a lot less work if I followed a few rules:

1. **Always** wrap shell _commands_ & package names in `backticks`. NPM is a word, but `npm` is a _command_.

2. **Always** wrap shell _output_ in _code fences_:

   > Any invalid prose will throw false-positives here.

   ```
   While you can put anything here

   ERROR: MakingUpStuff.js#34:10
   ```

3. Avoid clever words like `Vue-ify`, `templatize`, etc.

I'd _love_ to set up a [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) pre-commit hook, but [`ltex-cli`](https://valentjn.github.io/ltex/ltex-ls/cli-usage.html) doesn't seem to correctly process `.mdx` files outside of VS Code ðŸ¤”
