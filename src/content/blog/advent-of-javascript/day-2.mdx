I enjoyed [Advent of JavaScript, Day 1](../day-1) so much that I'm continuing with Day 2.

---

Challenge #2 is creating an _eCommerce component_:

With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-2-q7857?file=/index.html), I'm ready to get going!

---

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> ## Users should be able to:
>
> - View the plates on the left side of the screen and add them to your cart on the right side.

The moment there's duplication of data, **this data needs to be pulled out of the HTML and into a data-structure**.
This means, unlike [Day 1](../day-1), I won't be re-using most of the HTML, but instead _templatizing_ it.

The data looks like it has the following structure:

```js
interface MenuItem {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  image: string;
}

const menu: MenuItem[] = [
  {
    name: 'French Fries with Ketchup'
    price: 2.23,
    image: 'images/plate__french-fries.png',
  }
]

interface CartItem {
  menuItem: MenuItem;
  quantity: number;
}

const cart: CartItem[] = [
  {
    menuItem: {
      name: 'French Fries with Ketchup',
      price: 2.23,
      image: 'images/plate__french-fries.png',
    },
    quantity: 1,
  }
]
```

**Edit – Whoops! Turns out there's a `app.js` I missed that already has a mutable structure they intended:**

```js
const menuItems = [
  {
    name: "French Fries with Ketchup",
    price: 223,
    image: "plate__french-fries.png",
    alt: "French Fries",
    count: 0
  },
```

**Clearly this structure was intended to modify `count` directly then re-render the Menu & Cart panels in response.**

For these use-cases, I like using `MobX`. Specifically, [MobX-State-Tree (MST)](https://mobx-state-tree.js.org/intro/welcome).

MST allows me to use models and easily create relationships between them.
Plus, I don't have to think worry about mutations, context, or forcing re-renders in the views.

I've only used it with React, so whether this works with [`mobx-vue-lite`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-vue-lite) or via CDN is unknown.

What's _not_ said in this description is:

- Initially, menu items say _Add to Cart_.
- After clicking _Add to Cart_, the text changes to _In Cart_.
  - In the cart, the menu item appears with a default quantity of _1_.
  - The price is a multiple of the menu item price and the quantity.

> - When there are no plates within your cart, you should see a message that says, "Your cart is empty."

This should be simple by checking `state.cart.length === 0`.

> - When a plate is added to your cart, the Subtotal and Totals will automatically update.

MobX will handle this automatically via computed properties like `state.cart.subtotal`, `state.cart.tax`, & `state.cart.total`.

> - When products are in your cart, you should be able to increase and decrease the quantity.

Updating `state.cart[selectedIndex].quantity` should solve this.

> - A user should not be able to mark the quantity as a negative number.

`quantity` isn't a `<input>`, so this just means that once a `quantity < 1`, the menu item is removed from the `cart`.

The next bullet already covers this...

> - If the quantity goes down to 0, the user will have the option to delete or remove the product from their cart entirely.

According to the UI, this is handled automatically.

> - Tax is based on the state of Tennessee sales tax: 0.0975

Ok, so `state.cart.total: () => state.cart.subtotal * (1 + state.cart.tax)`.

## Validating the Technology Decisions

Before I get too deep, I want to make sure the following constraints hold true:

- Progressive enhancement

  For a complex menu, this isn't really true like it would be for a "tooltip" use-case.
  But, my goal is to "progressively enhance" and re-use markup as much as possible rather than re-writing the templates as React components.

- Install dependencies via a CDN (e.g. `<script>`)

  This is negotiable, since CodeSandbox can run CRA/Next.js apps.
  But, my hope is that it simplifies the process of running the app.

- MobX for state management

  I prefer to work with instances of models when data presumably comes from a structured DB in the backend.

- Vue for the view

  Using React would require rewriting the templates into components, and I'd like to learn Vue more.
  However, **if Vue cannot use MobX easily, it would be quicker to convert this project to React**.

So, to validate these choices, I'm going to add MobX & Vue to the demo, set up a counter and test reactivity.

### Vue

Making the HTML into a template is pretty easy.

First, I was able to converting the HTML to Vue:

```js
const { Vue } = window;

const menuItems = [...];

const App = {
  data() {
    return {
      menuItems
    };
  }
};

Vue.createApp(App).mount(document.querySelector(".wrapper"));
```

Next, I could faithfully recreate the static _To Go Menu_ from...

```html
<ul class="menu">
  <li>
    <div class="plate">
      <img
        src="images/plate__french-fries.png"
        alt="French Fries"
        class="plate"
      />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="menu-item">French Fries with Ketchup</p>
      <p class="price">$2.23</p>
      <button class="in-cart">
        <img src="images/check.svg" alt="Check" />
        In Cart
      </button>
    </div>
    ...
  </li>
</ul>
```

...to a loop with `v-for`:

```html
<ul class="menu">
  <li v-for="menuItem in menuItems">
    <div class="plate">
      <img :src="'images/' + menuItem.image" alt="menuItem.alt" class="plate" />
    </div>
    <div class="content">
      <p class="menu-item">{{ menuItem.name }}</p>
      <p class="price">{{ formatPrice(menuItem.price) }}</p>
      <button
        v-if="menuItem.count === 0"
        @click="addToCart(menuItem)"
        class="add"
      >
        Add to Cart
      </button>
      <button v-else class="in-cart">
        <img src="images/check.svg" alt="Check" />
        In Cart
      </button>
    </div>
  </li>
</ul>
```

### MobX

Since [`mobx-vue-lite`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-vue-lite) has a hard-dependency on `@vueuse/core`, I can't use it via CDN.

Knowing this, I'm **removing `mobx` and `mobx-state-tree`** from this use-case and instead going to mutate `menuItems` directly.

## Wiring up Your Cart

Now that I've removed technical complexity in favor of `Vue` + `menuItems`,
making Your Cart reactive only took a few steps.

1. Creating a `cartItems` computed property for those with `count > 0`:

   ```js
   computed: {
     cartItems() {
       return this.menuItems.filter((menuItem) => menuItem.count > 0);
     }
   },
   ```

1. Having a `addtoCart(menuItem)` method that updates the `count` of the menu item:

   ```js
   methods: {
     addToCart(menuItem) {
       menuItem.count = 1;
     }
   }
   ```

   Luckily, this is _almost exactly_ what it would've looked like with `mobx-state-tree`, so win-win!

1. Replacing static HTML with reactive data:

   ```html
   <ul v-if="cartItems.length > 0" class="cart-summary">
     <li v-for="cartItem in cartItems">
       <div class="plate">
         <img
           :src="'images/' + cartItem.image"
           :alt="cartItem.alt"
           class="plate"
         />
         <div class="quantity">{{ cartItem.count }}</div>
       </div>
       <div class="content">
         <p class="menu-item">{{ cartItem.name }}</p>
         <p class="price">{{ formatPrice(cartItem.price) }}</p>
       </div>
       <div class="quantity__wrapper">
         <button @click="decreaseCount(cartItem)" class="decrease">
           <img src="images/chevron.svg" />
         </button>
         <div class="quantity">{{ cartItem.count }}</div>
         <button @click="increaseCount(cartItem)" class="increase">
           <img src="images/chevron.svg" />
         </button>
       </div>
       <div class="subtotal">
         {{ formatPrice(cartItem.price * cartItem.count) }}
       </div>
     </li>
   </ul>
   ```

1. Adjusting `count` with dedicated `increaseCount` and `decreaseCount` methods:

   ```js
    increaseCount(cartItem) {
      ++cartItem.count;
    },
    decreaseCount(cartItem) {
      --cartItem.count;
    },
   ```

1. Formatting currency using [`Intl.NumberFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat):

   ```js
   methods: {
     formatPrice(price) {
       return new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
         style: "currency",
         currency: "USD"
       }).format(price / 100);
     }
   }
   ```

1. Lastly, computing `subtotal`, `tax`, and `total`:

   ```js
   subtotal() {
     return this.cartItems.reduce((acc, cartItem) => {
       return acc + cartItem.price * cartItem.count;
     }, 0);
   },
   tax() {
     return this.subtotal * 0.08;
   },
   total() {
     return this.subtotal + this.tax;
   }
   ```

## Finishing Up

This exercise took ~1 hour, end-to-end thanks to [Day 1](../day-1)'s experience.

It showed how, though I initially wanted to leverage technology that I was familiar with in the past,
**they simply weren't necessary nor worth the complexity or bloat.**

Would I introduce `mobx` if this were a larger project? _Maybe_?
I would first want to know what is the canonical way to manage relationships & model instances in Vue.

Heck, it may be true that POJO (plain old JavaScript objects) are a good fit for this use-case!

**I was genuinely surprised how _smart_ Vue is with automatically tracking nested mutations** –
I didn't have to change much of the HTML at all. In fact, I was mostly _deleting_ markup and replacing it
with `v-for` or `v-if`.
