Challenge #3 is creating a keyboard game:

With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-3-sep2s?file=/index.html), I'm ready to get going!

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> ## Users should be able to:
>
> - See the keyboard centered on the page

Done!

> - Whenever a user hovers over a specific key it will change colors
>   - White keys will change to yellow #ffd200

Done!

> - Black keys will change to pink #f40082

Done!

> - When a user clicks on a specific key, it will play an audio clip.

This seems straightforward – [`new Audio(url)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLAudioElement/Audio).

> - The audio clips are numbered, but I did not specifically number the keys. You can pick which key should be associated with each audio file.

The files are named `audio/key-{1-23}.mp3`, so the initial implementation can just increment by key position.

> - If a user clicks on one key, then immediately clicks on a second key. The 2 files should both play. Meaning, clicking on one key will not stop an existing audio file from playing.

What this tells me is that there won't be a re-use of variable references.

## Initial Approach

- Vanilla JS (no libraries), since there doesn't seem to be much complexity here

- `document.querySelectorAll('.piano a')` to find all keys
- `.addEventListener('click', ...)` to listen for clicks
- `new Audio(url)` to create & `.play` the audio

  The URLs load asynchronously, so it may be best to initialize these immediately and `.play` once clicked.

## Making it Work

This wasn't much of a challenge. I was able to get this completed while an episode of SpongeBob was playing...

Anyway, the only surprise was with the SVG keys being out of order:
_the `<a>` elements aren't in left-to-write order, but seemingly random in the SVG._

To solve this, I used `.sort` to find the mid-point of each key and order those left-to-right:

```js {3, 10}
const keyElements = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('.piano a'))

keyElements.sort((a, b) => {
  const aRect = a.getBoundingClientRect()
  const aMiddle = aRect.left + aRect.width / 2

  const bRect = b.getBoundingClientRect()
  const bMiddle = bRect.left + bRect.width / 2

  return aMiddle - bMiddle
})
```

Then, I mapped those keys to the sound they would play:

```js {2}
const keyAudios = keyElements.map((keyElement, i) => {
  return new Audio(`audio/key-${i + 1}.mp3`)
})
```

_(The browser automatically marks these as `preload`, so they should be ready to go once you click a key.)_

One way to associate clicks-to-keys is to `keyElements.forEach(keyElement, ...)` and `keyElement.addEventListener('click', ...)`.

An alternative is to use `window.addEventListener('click', ...)`, so there's _one_ event listener rather than _N_ (23).

This optimization isn't necessary here, but can be a good idea when indiscriminately adding events to an unknown number of elements:

- Points on a graph
- Rows in a table
- Links on a page
- etc.

```js {3, 14-15}
window.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
  // click is on the `<path>`, so traverse up to the <a>
  const a = event.target.parentNode

  if (!keyElements.includes(a)) {
    return
  }

  event.preventDefault()

  const i = keyElements.indexOf(a)
  const audio = keyAudios[i]

  audio.currentTime = 0
  audio.play()
})
```

Since each `keyAudios` is separate, the sounds automatically overlap.

But, I wanted to make sure repeatedly clicking a key would _repeat_ the sound from the beginning.
The `Audio` API **does not have a `.stop` or `.restart` method**, so setting `audio.currentTime = 0` effectively accomplishes the same thing.
