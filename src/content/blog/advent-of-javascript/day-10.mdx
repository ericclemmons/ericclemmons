Challenge #10 is creating a code verification screen, like you see with 2-factor authentication:

I decided to **mix it up and use [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) instead of Vue for this one!**

With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-javascript-day-10-0lvw8), I'm ready to get going!

_(CodeSandbox let's you drag-and-drop files to upload, too!)_

## User Requirements

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> - type in a digit and automatically be taken to the next input

I like these UIs because they make the length requirements clear via distinct inputs.
However, what's weird is when you fix one of the digits out of order.
Normally, the text would be inserted, but with a fixed amount, then what?

I'm going to limit `maxLength` to `1` and `onKeyUp` find the next `<input>` and `.focus()` it.

> - paste in a 4 digit code

There's a [`paste`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/paste_event) event that I can listen to.

When this happens **only on the 1st input**, hopefully I can capture the full code and replace all `<input>` values.

## Wiring it Up

1. Adapting to Svelte

   Unlike my previous Vue implementations, Svelte's `index.html` is _bare_, just like most SPAs.

   ```html {9,13}
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
       <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
       <title>10 - 4 Digit Code || Advent of JavaScript</title>

       <link rel="stylesheet" href="public/bundle.css" />
     </head>

     <body>
       <script src="bundle.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

   To be fair, Vue would also be bare if I were using templates & components instead of progressive-enhancement.

   But since this is my 1st bundled challenge, it was a bit of a shock to not just "wire things up" and instead have to port code.

   I copy/pasted what was inside the original `index.html`'s `<body>` into `App.svelte`:

   ```html {2}
   <script>
     import './public/styles.css'
   </script>

   <div class="wrapper">
     <h1>Authorization Code</h1>
     <p>Please enter the code that we sent to (***) *** - 2819.</p>
     <form action="">
       <div class="fields">
         <input type="text" maxlength="1" value="1" name="verification_1" />
         <input type="text" maxlength="1" value="" name="verification_2" />
         <input type="text" maxlength="1" value="" name="verification_3" />
         <input type="text" maxlength="1" value="" name="verification_4" />
       </div>
       <button>Verify</button>
     </form>
   </div>
   ```

   Just like in modern bundlers like `esbuild`, `rollup`, & `webpack`, I can `import "styles.css"` and the bundler figures it out for me.

   (I prefer this over shoving everything in `/public` – colocation is a good thing.)

1. `bind:value`

   Rathern than 4 distinct `<input>` fields, I used Svelte's `{#each}` & `bind:value={digits[i]}`:

   ```html {2,5,7}
   <script>
     let digits = new Array(4)
   </script>

   {#each digits as digit, i}
   <input
     bind:value="{digits[i]}"
     min="1"
     max="9"
     maxlength="1"
     size="1"
     type="number"
   />
   {/each}
   ```

   **Note – There's [apparently _no way_](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9555143/html-maxlength-attribute-not-working-on-chrome-and-safari) for vanilla HTML to restrict the `value` to a single 1-9 digit.**

1. Auto-focus Inputs

   Using `bind:this`, I assigned each `<input>` to the `inputs` array and advanced `on:input`:

   ```html {5,14,16,23,25}
   <script>
     import './styles.css'

     let digits = new Array(4)
     let inputs = new Array(4)
     $: code = digits.join('')

     function nextInput(event) {
       const input = event.target
       const i = inputs.indexOf(input)
       const nextInput = inputs[i + 1]

       if (nextInput) {
         nextInput.focus()
       } else {
         input.blur()
       }
     }
   </script>

   {#each digits as digit, i}
   <input
     bind:this="{inputs[i]}"
     bind:value="{digits[i]}"
     on:input="{nextInput}"
     min="1"
     max="9"
     maxlength="1"
     size="1"
     type="number"
   />
   {/each}
   ```

1. Handling `paste` events

   Thanks to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/paste_event),
   this was a simple `on:paste|preventDefault` bound to `handlePaste`:

   ```js {3,4,6}
   function handlePaste(event) {
     let paste = (event.clipboardData || window.clipboardData).getData('text')
     digits = paste.split('').slice(0, 4)

     event.target.blur()
   }
   ```

   I replaced `digits` with the value of `paste` (e.g. `"1234"`).
   Svelte is really nice in that it lets me mutate values and **I don't need to manage state directly**.

   Then, I `.blur()` so that extra input isn't accidentally entered.

   I decided to allow paste within _any_ of the inputs since the expectation is that the _entire_ code will be in the clipboard anyway.

   ```html {4}
   <input
     bind:this="{inputs[i]}"
     on:input="{handleInput}"
     on:paste|preventDefault="{handlePaste}"
     ...
   />
   ```

1. 1-Digit Only

   Eventually I decided to have `on:input` force the single-digit:

   ```js
   input.value = input.value[0]
   ```

   Yes, this assumes the 1st digit is the correct one, but I was getting annoyed by this quirk.

## Conclusion

I have to say, despite [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) not having a CDN, run-time version,
it was a breeze to work with in CodeSandbox and I really enjoyed the strict linting.

This was especially true when I did `{#each item in items}` and the linter said, "Did you mean `as`?"

I'm going to give Svelte another try soon and see when (and if) I run into limitations...
