Challenge #4 is creating a computer keyboard that jiggles the key it wants you to press:

With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-4-l4umn?file=/index.html), I'm ready to get going!

## User Requirements

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> - See the computer keyboard centered on the page

Done already via `styles.css`.

> - A random letter will start to jiggle.

The animation already exists via `styles.css`' `jiggle` class.

As for choosing a _random_ letter, each `<button>` has a `data-key` that indicates what should be pressed (e.g. `TAB`).
I can randomly pick one of these (ideally, from a dwindling list, so repeats don't happen) and toggle `jiggle`.

> - The user should type the same key that's jiggling, and it will stop.

I'll need to double-check the [`KeyboardEvent` properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent#properties)
to support `SHIFT` & possibly others.

Otherwise, string matching against `event.key` should be enough!

> - A new, random key will start jiggling

I can have a `randomizeKey` function that will randomly pick a key from the `<button>`s and toggle `jiggle`.

## Wiring it Up

So, this was actually a little more fun than I expected!

1. Getting a list of `keys` is straightforward:

   ```js
   let keys = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('[data-key]'))
   ```

1. So is toggling the `jiggle` class:

   ```js {1,4}
   if (currentKey) currentKey.classList.remove('jiggle')

   currentKey = keys[i]
   currentKey.classList.add('jiggle')
   ```

1. And listening to events:

   ```js
   window.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
     if (event.key.toUpperCase() === currentKey.getAttribute('data-key')) {
       randomizeKey()
     }
   })
   ```

   I also listen to `click` events, so I can click the Caps lock button (since I have it mapped to `Escape` on my keyboard):

   ```js
   window.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
     if (event.target.hasAttribute('data-key')) {
       randomizeKey()
     }
   })
   ```

### Algorithms

But, what I **haven't** done before was **swapping variables without an intermediate value**
and **an optimal, simple shuffling algorithm**.

1. Swapping variables without an intermediate value is easy with ES6:

   ```js
   ;[a, b] = [b, a]
   ```

   For this use-case, I swapped the random `i` key with key at the `end` of the array:

   ```js
   ;[keys[i], keys[end]] = [keys[end], keys[i]]
   ```

1. Next, I wanted to see if there's an official algorithm to what I proposed above, and there is: [Fisher-Yates Shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle)

   There's a fantastic visualization from [Mike Bostocks](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/):

   <Shuffle />

   ```js {3, 7, 17}
   const randomizeKey = () => {
     // If there are no available keys left, restart the shuffle
     if (end === 0) end = keys.length

     // Pick a random index from 0 to the end of the array,
     // then shorten the array
     i = Math.floor(Math.random() * end--)

     // Stop jiggling the current key
     if (currentKey) currentKey.classList.remove('jiggle')

     currentKey = keys[i]
     currentKey.classList.add('jiggle')

     // Swap random key with the key at the end.
     // This ensures it won't get picked again since it's been "shuffled" out to the end
     ;[keys[i], keys[end]] = [keys[end], keys[i]]
   }
   ```

   1. Initially, the `end` index is the length of the array.
   1. We randomly pick `i` from 0 to the `end` of the array.
   1. We decrement `end` by 1 so that we can move the random keys to the end of the array.
   1. Using the previous swap algorithm, we swap the randomly selected key with the untouched key at the end.
   1. After we finish shuffling and the `end` is `0`, we reset it back to `keys.length` & reshuffle the shuffled array all over again.

## Demo

I spent the most time actually writing this blog post and porting over [Mike Bostocks' visualization](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/shuffle/) :)
