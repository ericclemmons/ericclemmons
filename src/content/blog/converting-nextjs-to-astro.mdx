After first [Converting Next.js to Qwik](./convering-nextjs-to-qwik) then cutting short my attempt at _Converting Next.js to Remix_, I decided to give [Astro](https://astro.build/) another shot, now that it's [1.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-1/).

> **Updated on 2023-01-24**

> [Astro 2.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-2/) has been released and [there are small changes](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/upgrade-to/v2/) that I had to make.
> See this PR for more details: [Upgrade to Astro 2.0](https://github.com/ericclemmons/ericclemmons/pull/5)

## Requirements

- [Spotlight](https://tailwindui.com/templates/spotlight) Tailwind CSS Theme
- [Tailwind CSS Support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
- [MDX Support](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/)
- [Image Resizing](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/images/#astros-image-integration)
- [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/#the-content-directory)

## Friction Log

### [Official Integrations](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/)

These were the first thing I consulted to make sure migrating a "brownfield" project would have reduced friction.

Eventually I settled on installing the following with 1 command:

- [React](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/)
- [Vercel](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/vercel/)
- [Sitemap](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/sitemap/)
- [MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- [Tailwind](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/tailwind/)
- [image](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/)

```shell
pnpm astro add react vercel sitemap mdx tailwind image
```

The fact that Astro **shows you what changed** is a great DX. Most CLI's will modify `package.json` & configs, but it's up to you to recognize the changes the next time you run `git add -p`.

### `<script>`

I admit, I'm tired of `<script dangerouslySetInnerHtml>` in React & Next.js, in particular.

Attempting to set content creates hydration issues between the server & client (usually due to an HTML entity encoding issue), loss of syntax highlighting, and other friction.

Astro, instead, **[treats script tags the way you'd want](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#using-script-in-astro)**.
This _just works_:

```html
<script>
  console.log('Welcome, browser console!')
</script>
```

- Astro process the `<script>`, so imports and dependencies are bundled
- `<script is:inline>` skips the processing

### Prettier

With the [VS Code](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/#vs-code) extension installed, I expected my usual format-on-save to work, but it didn't. I forgot I had to create `prettier.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  singleQuote: true,
  semi: false,
  plugins: [require('prettier-plugin-tailwindcss')],
}
```

### `node_modules`

When I'm missing a dependency, such as [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx), the build predictably fails. **But**, if I install it in another terminal window, Astro _rebuilds_ the page without anything else from me!

### `<Image />` doesn't work within React components, only `.astro` components

[Improve error handling for `@astrojs/image` within react components](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/5673#top)

### `rss.xml`

[Install Astro‚Äôs RSS package](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/4/#install-astros-rss-package), and this is pretty much ready to go!

### [`class:list`](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/directives-reference/#classlist) instead of [`clsx`](https://github.com/lukeed/clsx)

When setting `className` conditionally, `clsx` is a common approach and is used by Tailwind UI.

Personally, I prefer doing the following:

```js
<button
  className={[
    'bg-blue-700',
    'text-white',
    disabled ? 'opacity-50' : false,
  ].filter(Boolean)}
  disabled={disabled}
>
```

### Content Collections

Where I struggled with Qwik was getting a list of all the content on the file system.

Astro has a guide on [Importing Markdown](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#importing-markdown) that amounts to `import`ing a file specifically or `Astro.glob('*.md')` (my preference).

However, I'm interested in trying Astro's [Content Collections (Experimental)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/) so that frontmatter is strictly enforced, there can be different subsections of content, and content is separate from the theme.

A couple of things immediately impressed me!

First, it's a cinch to fetch & render data automatically:

```astro
---
import { getCollection, getEntry } from "astro:content"
import Post from "@/components/Post.astro"

const posts = await getCollection('blog')
const post = await getEntry('blog', 'javascript-fatigue.mdx')
const { Content } = post.render();
---

posts.map(post => <Post post={post} />)

<Content />
```

Second, `getCollection` is _automatically typed_ with the **actual data**. This means that TypeScript knows what posts exist, what their slugs are, and all of their metadata.

This caught errors in my frontmatter where I was incorrectly specifying dates!

```js
import { z, defineCollection } from 'astro:content'

const blog = defineCollection({
  schema: {
    date: z.date(),
    summary: z.string().optional(),
    tags: z.array(z.string()).default([]),
    title: z.string(),
  },
})

export const collections = { blog }
```

After much usage, my biggest complaint is that `getEntry` isn't equivalent to a faster, single function for `getCollection('blog').find(({ slug }) => Astro.params.slug )`.

You have to know the extension the file, which can be `.md` or `.mdx`.

I'm using `.mdx` everywhere, so `getEntry('blog', 'javascript-fatigue.mdx')` isn't much a problem, but it feels like there should be a direct equivalent between URL's `slug` & the equivalent on the file system without having TypeScript errors:

```
Argument of type '`${string}.mdx`' is not assignable to parameter of type '"3-ways-to-define-webpack-loaders.mdx" | "advent-of-javascript/day-1.mdx" | "advent-of-javascript/day-10.mdx" | "advent-of-javascript/day-17.mdx" | "advent-of-javascript/day-2.mdx" | ... 29 more ... | "writing-paralysis.mdx"'.
```

A "gotcha" is that [Custom components with imported MDX](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/markdown-content/#custom-components-with-imported-mdx) **only work with `.mdx` content, not `.md`**.

I expected that at least `h1`, `h2`, `p`, etc. would work (not actually _components_) with `<Content components={...} />`, but no.

### Converting from React to `.astro`

What I've found is that presentational (read: stateless) components are pretty straightforward to convert.

For example, here's a simple React component:

```tsx
import { Card } from '@/components/Card'

function Appearance({ title, description, event, cta, href }) {
  return (
    <Card as="article">
      <Card.Title as="h3" href={href}>
        {title}
      </Card.Title>
      <Card.Eyebrow decorate>{event}</Card.Eyebrow>
      <Card.Description>{description}</Card.Description>
      <Card.Cta>{cta}</Card.Cta>
    </Card>
  )
}
```

Generally, the steps are:

1. Separate the code from the template with `---`
2. Remove `return (...)`
3. Pull destructured `props` from `Astro.props`
4. Replace `{children}` with `<slot />`
5. Rename `className` to `class` on HTML elements (but not Components!)

```astro
---
import { Card } from '@/components/Card'
const { title, description, event, cta, href } = Astro.props
---
<Card as="article">
  <Card.Title as="h3" href={href}>
    {title}
  </Card.Title>
  <Card.Eyebrow decorate>{event}</Card.Eyebrow>
  <Card.Description>{description}</Card.Description>
  <Card.Cta>{cta}</Card.Cta>
</Card>
```

For stateful components, I either opt to leave them as React components (because mutations and re-rendering can get complicated!) or moving side effects to a separate [Client-Side Scripts](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#client-side-scripts).

### `<head />`

I do prefer [next/head](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/head) for composing `<title>` and `<meta>` tags within the page itself.

For example, a title like _"23 Results Found"_ would come from `search.astro`.

Astro's solution is to pass `props` to a [Layout](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/layouts/#sample-layout):

```jsx
<Layout title={`${results.length}` Results Found`}>
  <h1>Search results<h1>
  ...
```

I originally tried to use [Named Slots](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/astro-components/#named-slots) for this, but it didn't work:

```html
<!-- layout.astro -->
<head>
  <slot name="title" />
</head>
```

```html
<!-- page.astro -->
<title slot="title">My title</title>
```

This would just render `<title>` where it existed in the page rather than in the layout.

### Script Loading

When using [Content Collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/), [Script loading](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/#script-loading) doesn't work the same as with `.astro` files. This is called out in the docs, but mentally it's easy to forget what constraints your MDX writing.

Especially when writing content with live, component examples.

The solution is to move components & scripts into a `.astro` file, then `import` it at the top of the MDX file.

### Vercel Framework

Because `main` was currently a Next.js project, all of my preview builds were failing because `next` couldn't be found.

To fix this, I explicitly set the [framework](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration#project-configuration/framework) to `astro` in `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "framework": "astro"
}
```

I wish Vercel would auto-detect the framework from the `package.json` rather than having it explicitly set in the GUI's "Project Settings".

**The documentation should add this to the Troubleshooting section rather than rely on Vercel's inference, which only works for greenfield projects.**

### Periodic Crashes

When intermixing React JSX + Astro, periodically I would get errors like these:

```
/src/components/Button.astro:8
  const Astro2 = $$result.createAstro($$Astro, $$props, $$slots);
                          ^

TypeError: $$result.createAstro is not a function
    at eval (/src/components/Button.astro:8:27)
```

The dev server would hard-crash with this error & I'd have to restart. It takes mostly trial & error to resolve it since the error message contains `eval`'d code, not actual source üòî

I've found that having Astro components render React that also try to re-use Astro components is often the problem. In these cases, converting all leaf nodes to Astro components and working up to the top-level React components resolves the errors.

**Still, I'd rather there be a `500` screen from Astro and not have to restart the dev-server.**

### `React.useId()`

In isomorphic React applications, there's a need to have dynamic, yet consistent, IDs between the server & client for hydration:

> `useId` is a React Hook for generating unique IDs that can be passed to accessibility attributes.
> ‚Äì¬†[https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useId](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useId)

I was naively looking for the equivalent from Astro until I remembered that \*\*Astro components are static & rendered by the server and not hydrated:

> [Can I Hydrate Astro Components?](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#can-i-hydrate-astro-components)

Instead, I can generate a unique `id` simply with:

```js
const id = `section-${Math.random().toString(16)}`
```

### [Preact](https://preactjs.com/)

Once I get my apps working, I migrate to [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) to save bundle sizes. Because this was a migration, it makes sense to migrate _later_ than in the beginning and potentially break existing functionality.

[Integrating Preact](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/preact/) automatically took care of most of the changes:

### It's FAST

Subsequent builds take **~5s**.

### Image & Picture

[`@astrojs/image`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#installation) provides 2 dynamic components:

- [`<Image />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#image-)
- [`<Picture />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#picture-)

In practice, `<Picture>` is most analogous to [next/image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) for **responsive images** because it also supports the [sizes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLImageElement/sizes) attribute.

The only difficult is also providing [widths](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#widths) in pixels when Tailwind's units are ambiguous ‚Äì `w-72` might mean `18rem`, or `288px` ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

For non-responsive images, `<Image>` is pretty much like `<img>`, except that `width` **or** `height` need to be provided alongside `aspectRatio`.

I typically set a maximum `width` of `1024` and a `aspectRatio` of `16:9`.

But what makes these so handy is that I can use a `import` statement for the `src`!

```jsx
<Image
  alt="My desk"
  aspectRatio="16:9"
  src={import('@/images/photos/desk.jpg')}
  width={1200}
/>
```

For SVGs, in the future I'll look into [`astro-icon`](https://github.com/natemoo-re/astro-icon).

### Social Images

Unfortunately, to use [`@vercel/og`](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation) **requires [Edge Runtime](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/edge-functions-api)** ([Limits](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/edge-functions/og-image-generation#limits))

I... didn't see this until late at night after experimenting for several hours üò≥

But, [`@astrojs/image` **does not** support the Edge Runtime](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/image/#installation)!

I was able to get [social images running locally, but failing on Vercel](https://github.com/ericclemmons/ericclemmons/pull/3/commits/e50d741779502abd69aeab838f26f10c0cd0f776), likely due to `yoga-wasm-web/asm`, `satori/wasm`, and `sharp` for rendering.

With a clear head today, I'm going to try out [`resvg-js`](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js) for rendering & see if that makes the difference.

I did learn something new about **importing `?raw` files in Astro/Vite**, though! Binary doesn't cleanly get imported for use by `satori`.

So instead, I modified my `astro.config.mjs` with a custom [`hexLoader`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73847316/import-raw-image-data-into-a-script-with-vite)

```js
/** @type {import('vite').Plugin} */
const hexLoader = {
  name: 'hex-loader',
  transform(code, id) {
    const [path, query] = id.split('?')
    if (query != 'raw-hex') return null

    const data = fs.readFileSync(path)
    const hex = data.toString('hex')

    return `export default '${hex}';`
  },
}

export default defineConfig({
  ...
  vite: {
    plugins: [hexLoader],
  },
})
```

Then, I could import the fonts via `?raw-hex`:

```js
import ttf from '../../../public/Inter/static/Inter-Regular.ttf?raw-hex'
```

And finally create a [`ArrayBuffer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer) by:

```js
const fromHexString = (hexString) =>
  Uint8Array.from(hexString.match(/.{1,2}/g).map((byte) => parseInt(byte, 16)))

const inter = fromHexToString(ttf)
```

üò∞

Even worse, just trying to use `satori@^1.0.0` has tons of ESM/CJS issues, even when using [`ssr.noExternal`](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/3174#issuecomment-1138958697):

```
require() of ES Module ./node_modules/.pnpm/yoga-wasm-web@0.3.0/node_modules/yoga-wasm-web/dist/asm.js from ./node_modules/.pnpm/satori@0.1.0/node_modules/satori/dist/index.cjs not supported.
  Instead change the require of asm.js in ./node_modules/.pnpm/satori@0.1.0/node_modules/satori/dist/index.cjs to a dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules.
```

Based on [some other examples I found](https://github.com/zernonia/keypress/blob/main/server/routes/og/%5Bslug%5D.ts), `satori` works with `v0.0.45`, so this is clearly a bug with Satori.

But the problem is, even when I get this working locally, is that Vercel has cryptic errors that I have no way of diagnosing:

```

```

On a hunch, I went to a preview build for `/api/og.png`, and [it worked](https://ericclemmons-f2ooeiz43-ericclemmons.vercel.app/api/og.png?title=Migrating%20to%20the%20Apple%20MacBook%20Air%20M2)!

So it looks like serving _normal content_ is failing on Vercel with `output: server` with [this change](https://github.com/ericclemmons/ericclemmons/compare/1b122d5e41ff5b2febf8315640a49a0e45e0b637..cb47aa9d5e4fc671fc7e1f7b2813a092df6552c8) ü§î

**Resolved ‚Äì It was a bug in Astro `<Image>` component that's [since been fixed](https://github.com/ericclemmons/ericclemmons/compare/c25849980cfc5824eaec53846a6a1a337eec6d25..381971b5d4734f6a50cd31edbeac2743fb796e21)**. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Preview Builds & [import.meta.env](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/environment-variables/#default-environment-variables)

I found that I was always getting `import.meta.env.DEV === true` in my preview builds.

So instead, I used `Astro.url.origin` to be consistent across environments:

```diff
-const SITE = import.meta.env.PROD
-  ? import.meta.env.SITE
-  : 'http://localhost:3000'
+const { origin } = Astro.url
```

### Sitemap & SSR

When running `pnpm build` with an SSR site, you'll get this warning:

```shell
@astrojs/sitemap: Skipped!
No pages found! We can only detect sitemap routes for "static" builds. Since you are using an SSR adapter, we recommend manually listing your sitemap routes using the "customPages" integration option.

Example: `sitemap({ customPages: ['https://example.com/route'] })`
```

What sucks is that this config can't use `import { getCollection } from 'astro:content'`, utilities in `src/lib/getPosts.ts`, `Astro.glob`, or really anything you're used to.

The only thing available is `import.meta.glob('./src/content/**/*.mdx')`.

Using this, I basically reproduced what `getCollection('blog')` does:

```js
const site = import.meta.env.PROD
  ? 'https://ericclemmons.com'
  : 'http://localhost:3000'
const paths = import.meta.glob('./src/content/**/*.mdx')
const slugs = Object.keys(paths).map((file) =>
  file.split('./src/content/').pop().split('.mdx').shift()
)
const customPages = slugs.map((slug) => `${site}/${slug}`)

...

export default defineConfig({
  site,
  integrations: [
    sitemap({ customPages })
  ]
});
```

Unfortunately, the same issues with `import.meta.env.PROD === false` are true in preview branches for `astro.config.mjs`.

To fix this, I exposed [System Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables#system-environment-variables) to the build and conditionally use `process.env.PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL`:

![](/static/images/env.png)

```js
const site = process.env.PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL
  ? `https://${process.env.PUBLIC_VERCEL_URL}`
  : 'http://localhost:3000'
```

But now that `customPages` are working, my [sitemap is missing all `src/pages/*`](https://ericclemmons-qw4sm8v8m-ericclemmons.vercel.app/sitemap-0.xml)!

My final `customPages` is now computed via:

```js
const content = Object.keys(import.meta.glob('./src/content/**/*.mdx')).map(
  (file) => file.split('./src/content/').pop().split('.mdx').shift()
)
const pages = Object.keys(import.meta.glob('./src/pages/**/*.astro')).map(
  (file) => file.split('./src/pages/').pop().split('.astro').shift()
)
const customPages = [...pages, ...content].map((slug) => `${site}/${slug}`)
```

## Conclusion

With the [majority of the work done](https://github.com/ericclemmons/ericclemmons/pull/3) to convert my blog, I'm left with the following impressions:

1. Astro **feels like the old days of the web.**
   This is a good thing. HTML is HTML, `<script>` and `<style>` tags are copy/paste-able, and modern libraries like Svelte, Vue, & React are an extension away.

   It feels like I start with _form_, then get to choose how to progressively add _function_. [Remix](https://remix.run/) may say the same, as it centralizes on primitives like Request & Response. But being React-first rather than _HTML_-first means abstractions for `link`/`style`/`script` are essential.

2. Astro's growth and positive impressions are warranted, & will only improve:

3. With this growth, bugs are shallower but **getting _fixed pretty fast_**.
4. There are still rough edges with boilerplate around dynamic content, sitemaps, dynamic `<head>` tags, & image optimization. But, it's clear that the team is **optimizing for these common use-cases and rapidly experimenting**.

Astro will likely become my default framework for new projects and multi-framework apps (such as documentation sites & component libraries) üéâ
