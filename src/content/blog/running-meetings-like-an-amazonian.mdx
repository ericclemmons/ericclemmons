[Writing Design Docs like an Amazonian](./design-doc-like-an-amazonian)

_**Meeting guidelines**_

-   **_Identify the required attendees._** _Include subject matter experts for the space, team members, and stakeholders. You haven’t reviewed the design unless all of your required attendees have reviewed it. Prefer a realtime meeting with all attendees present to generate discussion._
    
-   _Add  [aws-mobile-design-interest@amazon.com](mailto:aws-mobile-design-interest@amazon.com)  as an optional attendee._
    
-   _**Reserve enough time.** Allocate 15 minutes at the beginning to review the document, but increase that if your design is particularly dense or long. Any substantive discussion is going to take 30 minutes unless all participants are already familiar with the components of the system._
    
-   _**State the goal.** Are you asking for feedback on a proposal? A decision amongst multiple proposals? Approval from the API Bar Raisers?_
    
-   _**Guide the discussion.** If this is a system design review, defer API naming to a later discussion._
    
-   _**Monitor your progress.** If you are requesting a decision amongst alternatives, and you haven’t reached it by 5 minutes before the end of the meeting, schedule a follow-up with the decision makers._
    
-   _**Consider a note-taker.** Having another person take notes and document follow-up actions frees you to guide the discussion and engage in conversation._
    


_Design Review Meeting_

-   _**The meeting is rushed.** The meeting is scheduled for 30 minutes, and 15-20 minutes of the meeting are required to read the doc. Discussion is truncated, and decisions are deferred to a followup meeting._
    
-   _Reserve enough time for reading and discussion_
    
-   _Don’t assume your audience has enough context to read through the document quickly_
    
-   _Put supplementary material at the end of the document, and add in-document instructions like “STOP READING HERE”_
    
-   _**The audience is limited.** The meeting attendees are all from the implementing team, limiting the diversity of perspectives._
    
-   _Add  [aws-mobile-design-interest@amazon.com](mailto:aws-mobile-design-interest@amazon.com)  to the meeting invite_
    
-   _Solicit other teams for interest_
    
-   _Ask a senior developer or manager for suggested attendees with subject matter expertise_
    
-   _**The discussion is unfocused.** The discussion veers into API naming, rather than focusing on the system design. (But beware the counterexample of the meeting moderator claiming that a relevant architecture discussion should be deferred to the API naming review.)_
    
-   _Remind attendees to focus on use case, architecture, and design decisions_
    
-   _Discuss high-level themes first. Add deep-dives to a Parking Lot and revisit at the end_
    
-   _Schedule followup meetings to dive deep on important issues_
