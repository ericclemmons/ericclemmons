My _13‚Äù MacBook Pro, Intel Core i7, 16GB RAM (2017)_ was lasting ~2 hours
at the coffeeshop, so decided to ugprade to the [MacBook Air M2](https://www.apple.com/macbook-air-m2/).

## Friction Log

1. Migrating from Previous Mac

   Migration Assistant actually did an _excellent_ job of bringing over apps & settings: [Move content to a new Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204350).

   What's most impressive is that it has a _Peer-to-Peer_ connection option that's faster than Wi-Fi.

   However, **anytime you get a warning about Rosetta to open an app, that's a sign you should reinstall it.**

2. Git

   When running `git`, I would get this error:

   > xcrun: error: invalid active developer path (/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools), missing xcrun at: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/xcrun.
   > ‚Äì [StackOverflow](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/254380/why-am-i-getting-an-invalid-active-developer-path-when-attempting-to-use-git-a)

   Solving this was easy as running:

   ```shell
   xcode-select --install
   ```

3. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)

   Installing `brew` is the foundation of all other macOS software.

   ```shell
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

4. Clipboard Manager

   [Jumpcut](https://snark.github.io/jumpcut/) has been with me for years as my favorite, minimal clipboard manager:

   ```shell
   brew install --cask jumpcut
   ```

   Plus, it's a stack for my memory when writing posts like this üòÖ

5. [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

   ```shell
   curl -fsSL https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh | sh -
   ```

6. Node

   By default, `node` didn't exist on this machine.

   Traditionally, I would manage Node with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm), or [volta](https://volta.sh/).

   But now that I exclusively use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/), **`pnpm` can manage `node` versions for me instead!**

   ```shell
   pnpm env use --global lts
   ```

   Then, you can tell `pnpm` to automatically install & respect this version when running `pnpm` commands in a project with [use-node-version](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#use-node-version)

   ```shell
   node --version > .npmrc
   ```

7. [pure](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure) prompt

   ```shell
   pnpm install --global pure-prompt
   ```

   Then, update [zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) to use it:

   ```shell
   # .zshrc
   autoload -U promptinit; promptinit
   prompt pure
   ```

8. VS Code

   Thanks to [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync), all of my
   settings were already saved & synced between machines.

## Conclusion

All-in-all, it took about an hour to get productive again (not including transferring files from Migration Assistant).

I used to think [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/) were the solution to this!

But my [dotfiles from 10 years ago](https://github.com/ericclemmons/dotfiles) were stale & irrelevant within _a year_. The ROI just didn't exist.
