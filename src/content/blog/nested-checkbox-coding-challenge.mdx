## Requirements

![](https://i.ibb.co/s18N9p5/nested-checkbox.png)

Implement a nested checkbox component that satisfies the following interface:

```ts
type CheckboxOption = {
  [key: string]: boolean | CheckboxOption;
};

const NestedCheckbox: ({
  value,
  onChange
}: {
  value: CheckboxOption;
  onChange: (value: CheckboxOption) => void;
}) => React.ReactNode;
```

The following input should produce the following output:

```tsx
const App = () => {
  const [value, onChange] = useState({
    foo: true,
    bar: false,
    group1: {
      level2: true,
      level2option2: false,
      nested: {
        option: true
      }
    }
  });

  return <NestedCheckbox value={value} onChange={onChange} />;
};
```

The requirements for the implementation are:

- The non-leaf checkboxes (those corresponding to object values) are checked only if all of their child leaf checkboxes are checked
- There is no state maintained insideÂ `NestedCheckbox`, as the component is fully controlled
- [EXTRA] Clicking a non-leaf checkbox will toggle all of its children on or off, depending its the current checked status

## Demo

 <NestedCheckboxDemo client:visible />

## Source

The problem I have with this problem is that the interface doesn't allow for recursiveness with reference to a top-level root.

With a top-level `onChange`, we could always mutate the initial `value` object directly and call `onChange(value)` to re-render the fully-controlled `NestedCheckbox`.

However, this means not being able to call `<NestedCheckbox value={childValue} onChange={onChange} />` because that would replace the top-level value.

So instead, I created a `refresh` wrapper function that triggers the parent `NestedCheckbox`'s `onChange`, eventually reaching the parent:

```tsx
const refresh = () => onChange(structuredClone(value))
```

1. This is passed to child `<NestedCheckbox value={childValue} onChange={refresh} />`, since I don't care about the child `value` updates and only want to refresh.
1. I'm using [`structuredClone`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/structuredClone), which is a performant alternative to `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(value))`.
