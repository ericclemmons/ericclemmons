title: Automatically generate commit messages with OpenCode
---

AI is _fine_ for vibe-coding, but I prefer to introduce my own "checkpoints" via commits.

I like to make a working, logical "chunk" of changes, and commit that atomic unit.

When Claude Code automatically generates commits, it's basically per-prompt.
But with all of the back-and-forth, I'd need to rebase or squash them.


<div className="not-prose">
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/ericclemmons/2a23cc0595c7570fd08f4fa2d3ddef48.js"></script>
</div>
