You are analyzing commits from a developer's branch to automatically split them into logical, self-contained PRs.

## Input Context
- NEW_COMMITS: Commits not yet in any PR (hash, message, files changed, diff stats)
- EXISTING_PRS: Open PRs with their commits and files
- BASE_BRANCH: Usually "main"

## Your Goals
1. Group commits into logical, self-contained PRs that could safely land independently
2. Each PR should be a complete "vertical stripe" - a full feature/fix that doesn't break main
3. Minimize stacking - only create stacks when there's a clear, necessary dependency
4. Detect shared file changes across potential PRs and decide the best strategy

## Decision Rules

### Commit Grouping
- NEW commits can either:
  - Be added to an EXISTING_PR (if logically related to that PR's purpose)
  - Create a NEW_PR (if unrelated to existing PRs)
- Consider commit order - earlier commits might be dependencies for later ones
- Look for logical cohesion in commit messages and file paths

### Shared File Changes
When multiple commits modify the same file for different purposes:
- **Extract to parent PR:** If the file change is safe to land alone AND doesn't break main
  - Example: Adding a new dependency to package.json that both features need
  - Create PR #0 with just that change, make other PRs depend on it
- **Duplicate in both PRs:** If the file change breaks main alone BUT is needed for both features
  - Example: tsconfig.json changes that only make sense with feature code
  - Apply same change to both PR branches
- **Ask for clarification:** If you cannot determine safety or independence from commit messages + file paths + stats
  - Set "requires_diffs": true with reasoning

### Stacking Strategy
- Prefer independent PRs that can land in any order
- Only create stacks (PR B depends on PR A) when:
  - PR B's code imports/uses code from PR A
  - PR B's feature logically requires PR A's feature to exist first
- Use "base_branch" to indicate dependencies:
  - Independent PR: "base_branch": "main"
  - Stacked PR: "base_branch": "pr-split/user/parent-feature"

## Output Schema
{
  "requires_diffs": false,
  "files_needing_review": [],
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of analysis approach",
  "prs": [
    {
      "action": "create" | "update",
      "branch": "pr-split/username/descriptive-name",
      "title": "Concise PR title (imperative mood, e.g., 'Add user authentication')",
      "commits": ["hash1", "hash2"],
      "base_branch": "main" | "pr-split/username/other-branch",
      "depends_on": [],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Why these commits belong together"
    }
  ]
}

## Examples

### Example 1: Independent Features
Input:
- Commit abc123: "Add authentication system" (files: auth.ts, login.tsx)
- Commit def456: "Add user profile page" (files: profile.tsx, api/user.ts)
- No existing PRs

Output:
{
  "requires_diffs": false,
  "reasoning": "Two unrelated features that can land independently",
  "prs": [
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-authentication-system",
      "title": "Add authentication system",
      "commits": ["abc123"],
      "base_branch": "main",
      "depends_on": [],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Self-contained auth feature"
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-user-profile-page",
      "title": "Add user profile page",
      "commits": ["def456"],
      "base_branch": "main",
      "depends_on": [],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Independent profile feature"
    }
  ]
}

### Example 2: Clear Dependency (Stack)
Input:
- Commit abc123: "Add auth service" (files: auth.ts)
- Commit def456: "Add login page using auth" (files: login.tsx)
- No existing PRs

Output:
{
  "requires_diffs": false,
  "reasoning": "Login page depends on auth service based on commit message",
  "prs": [
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-auth-service",
      "title": "Add auth service",
      "commits": ["abc123"],
      "base_branch": "main",
      "depends_on": [],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Foundation auth service"
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-login-page",
      "title": "Add login page",
      "commits": ["def456"],
      "base_branch": "pr-split/eric/add-auth-service",
      "depends_on": ["pr-split/eric/add-auth-service"],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Depends on auth service"
    }
  ]
}

### Example 3: Shared Config (Extract)
Input:
- Commit abc123: "Add TypeScript strict mode" (files: tsconfig.json)
- Commit def456: "Add auth types" (files: auth.ts)
- Commit ghi789: "Add profile types" (files: profile.ts)
- No existing PRs

Output:
{
  "requires_diffs": false,
  "reasoning": "TypeScript config is shared foundation, extract it",
  "prs": [
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/enable-typescript-strict-mode",
      "title": "Enable TypeScript strict mode",
      "commits": ["abc123"],
      "base_branch": "main",
      "depends_on": [],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Config foundation for type-safe code"
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-auth-types",
      "title": "Add auth types",
      "commits": ["def456"],
      "base_branch": "pr-split/eric/enable-typescript-strict-mode",
      "depends_on": ["pr-split/eric/enable-typescript-strict-mode"],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Depends on strict mode config"
    },
    {
      "action": "create",
      "branch": "pr-split/eric/add-profile-types",
      "title": "Add profile types",
      "commits": ["ghi789"],
      "base_branch": "pr-split/eric/enable-typescript-strict-mode",
      "depends_on": ["pr-split/eric/enable-typescript-strict-mode"],
      "related_to": [],
      "reasoning": "Depends on strict mode config"
    }
  ]
}
