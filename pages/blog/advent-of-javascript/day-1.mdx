For the first time ever, I'm going to attempt [Advent of JS](https://www.adventofjs.com/).

**Note – this post is a stream-of-conciousness and not a "How-to" guide.**

Challenge #1 is creating a _Pomodoro timer_:

**What I appreciate is that it begins with the most important criteria: _user stories_.**

> Users should be able to:
>
> - Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.
> - Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop. Then, the user can click on the stop button to make the timer stop.
> - Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.
> - Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.

As a tip, when interviewing and doing a System Design challenge, **User Requirements (also called General Requirements) are usually how you start**.
_Then_, you define Function (Technical) Requirements, Architecture, etc.

## How to Begin?

### Progressive Enhancement

After downloading the project files, the first thing I noticed is **it's all static HTML/CSS**.

This immediately reminded me of progressive enhancement, where server-rendered pages (often with PHP)
would have JavaScript loaded with `<script>` tags that would sprinkle in interactivity using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/).

> You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

So, I'd like to find a way of solving for interactivity **without rewriting HTML as React** to toggle the `disabled` attribute:

```html {3,7}
<div class="time">
  <div class="minutes">
    <input type="text" value="15" disabled />
  </div>
  <div class="colon">:</div>
  <div class="seconds">
    <input type="text" value="00" disabled />
  </div>
</div>
```

I'm thinking of using [Vue.js](https://v3.vuejs.org/), which recommends **not** using `vue-cli` for beginners.

Instead, I'll install Vue using a [CDN](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cdn)

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
```

### State Management

I've really enjoyed using [XState](https://xstate.js.org/) for the [Amplify UI Authenticator](https://ui.docs.amplify.aws/components/authenticator).

I can manage much of this state by hand with Vue, but I'd really like to have a vizualization and assurance that I don't end up with impossible states.

Luckily, XState can be installed using a [CDN](https://xstate.js.org/docs/packages/xstate-vue/#quick-start), too:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@xstate/vue/dist/xstate-vue.min.js"></script>
```

### Environment

Ok, so I've picked a framework ([Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/)) and a state library ([XState](https://xstate.js.org/)) to make this work.

But _where_ am I going to work?

_Advent of JS_ recommends using [LiveReload](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ziishaned.livereload),
but I'd prefer something public & embeddable by default, like [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) or [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).

Since I haven't used [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/), I'll give that a shot. They even [support uploading from your computer](https://developer.stackblitz.com/docs/platform/importing-projects/)!

## Setting Up The Environment

I chose a [Vanilla > Static (HTML/JS/CSS) Project](https://stackblitz.com/fork/web-platform),
but quickly learned I'd have to [pay $8 per month just to upload the files](https://stackblitz.com/membership).

I shelled out the money but **immediately cancelled the subscription because [StackBlitz cannot serve static CSS](https://dev.to/humberd/why-you-should-not-use-stackblitz-to-showcase-your-app-1cbf)**!

Back to [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) and [importing my project from the CLI](https://codesandbox.io/docs/importing):

```shell {3}
npm install -g codesandbox
cd STARTER_FILES
codesandbox ./
```

2 minutes later, [my CodeSandbox is live](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-1-vpztf)!

## Wiring up Vue

Ok, I'm impressed! Vue only required [a few lines of code](https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#declarative-rendering) to wire up my markup:

```html {2,5}
<!-- https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#cdn -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>

<!-- Custom app logic -->
<script src="app.js" type="module"></script>
```

```js {1, 11}
const { Vue } = window

const Pomodoro = {
  data() {
    return {
      counter: 0,
    }
  },
}

Vue.createApp(Pomodoro).mount(document.querySelector('.wrapper'))
```

## Wiring up XState

Now that I know I can make my static markup interactive with Vue,
I'm going to model the _User Requirements_ as a [finite state machine](https://xstate.js.org/docs/basics/fsm.html)
using the [XState Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz):

> Users should be able to:
>
> - Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.

This tells me we'll begin in an `paused` state and have a `START` transition to a `running` state.

> - Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop. Then, the user can click on the stop button to make the timer stop.

Vue will observe the machine and do something like `state.matches('running')` to determine whether or not to render the stop button.
_In Advent of JS' own solution, the button says `pause`, not `stop`_.

When this button is clicked, it'll send a `STOP` event to the machine, which should transition back to `paused`.

> - Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.

When the machine is `paused`, an `EDIT` event will transition the machine to `editing`.

Vue will check for `state.matches('editing')` and toggle the `disabled` attribute accordingly.
These `input`s will fire `@change` events, which will send `CHANGE` signals to the machine that will `assign({ minutes, seconds })` to the machine's `context`.

> - Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.

I haven't ran a timer in XState before, but luckily there's an example: https://xstate.js.org/docs/tutorials/7guis/timer.html#coding

Normally, I would use `setInterval` when `running` and `clearInterval` when transitioning back to `paused`.

In the machine, I'll use a `TICK` event to `assign({ minutes, seconds })`

XState has a `cond`itional guard that can be used to check if both `minutes` and `seconds` are `0`.
When this happens, we'll transition to a `done` state.

Vue will match this with `state.matches('done')` to toggle the ring color.

**For `TICK`ing down, rather than subtracting `1` each second, I'll compare `endTime - startTime > 0`.**
_(I learned this trick when doing animations in MooTools because timers are unreliable, especially when there can be blocking threads.)_

Now that I've written this out, it only took ~10 minutes to [prototype the `pomodoro` machine](https://stately.ai/viz/722347f3-3323-48e6-b915-0974b677e378):

<iframe
  className="w-full h-96"
  src="https://stately.ai/viz/722347f3-3323-48e6-b915-0974b677e378"
/>

### Wiring up the UI

This is where we find out if initial assumptions _actually_ work :D

One constraint I imposed on myself was **not to expose XState's `state` or `send` directly to the view layer**:

```html
<input
  @input="send('CHANGE', { minutes: $event.target.value })"
  type="text"
  maxlength="2"
  :value="state.context.minutes"
  :disabled="!state.matches('paused')"
/>
```

Instead, there are `computed` properties and `methods` that are extension points:

```html
<input
  @input="handleMinutes"
  type="text"
  maxlength="2"
  :value="minutes"
  :disabled="!isEditing"
/>
```

In this case, `seconds` dynamically changes from `05` to `5` when `state.matchines('editing')`.

## Finishing Up

From here, much of the refinement of the state machine was trial-and-error from using the UI.
Subtle details not present in the _User Requirements_ were visible in their demo video:

- `pause` instead of `stop`.
- After the `alert` is dismissed, the timer resets.
- The timer pads number values with leading `0`s, but not when editing.

A few other things I learned along the way:

- It was easier to use `XState` alone rather than `XStateVue`.

  I would use `@xstate/vue` in a bundled environment, but via CDN it didn't seem to make things any easier.

- You cannot `.start(initialState)` a `service` that's transitioned to a `final` state!

  I thought I could restart the service & reset it, but I couldn't.
  Instead, I had to recreate it all over again with a `startMachine()` utility.

- This is my first time to actually use `<script type="module">` and `import` in the browser without a bundler!

All in all, I probably spent a couple of hours reading Vue & XState docs and working out the kinks.
The first hour covered ~80% of the functionality, but the last 20% was used to account for `''` values & resetting the machine.
