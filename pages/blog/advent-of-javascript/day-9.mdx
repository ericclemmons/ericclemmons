With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-javascript-day-8-9kkp6), I'm ready to get going!

## User Requirements

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> - toggle left and right through the image thumbnails

Alrighty, this seems simple:

- `currentIndex` is the index of the current image to replace `.feature`
- Event handlers on `.left` and `.right` to decrement and increment, respectively, `currentIndex`

> - click an image to select it manually

This will set the `currentIndex` to the index of the clicked image.

## Wiring it Up

With Vue, this should all be a cinch!

Id like to use transitions, since a quick Google shows that the `out-in` may work to make this seamless:

> https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/transitions.html#Transition-Modes

However, _probably not if I'm replacing elements vs. hidding/showing different ones_. I'm going to skip transitions for now...

1. Adding Vue, as usual:

   ```html
   <script src="https://unpkg.com/vue@next"></script>
   ```

   I find wiring up the markup first helps clarify the most semantic API before I start writing imperative (i.e. JavaScript) code.

1. Making `.feature` reactive:

   ```html {2,3}
   <div class="feature">
     <img :src="'images/' + currentImage.image" alt="Featured" />
     <div class="caption">{{ currentImage.caption }}</div>
   </div>
   ```

1. Making `.thumbnails` reactive:

   I wanted to make sure the thumbnails continued to scroll into view as `.left` and `.right` were clicked.
   Vue has a `ref` attribute that allows you to reference an element from the template, just like React:

   > https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/migration/array-refs.html#migration-strategy

   ```html {4-6,8,10,11}
   <div class="thumbnails">
     <ul>
       <li
         v-for="(item, index) in content"
         :class="{ selected: index === currentIndex }"
         :ref="setThumbnailRef"
       >
         <a @click.prevent="currentIndex = index" href="#">
           <img
             :src="'images/' + item.image"
             :alt="'Thumbnail of ' + item.caption"
           />
         </a>
       </li>
     </ul>
   </div>
   ```

1. Making `.left` and `.right` reactive:

   I modeled this after the `window.history.go(delta)` API:

   ```html {1,4}
   <a @click.prevent="go(-1)" href="#" class="left">
     <img src="./images/chevron.svg" alt="" />
   </a>
   <a @click.prevent="go(+1)" href="#" class="right">
     <img src="./images/chevron.svg" alt="" />
   </a>
   ```

## Demo

I think I need to try something different than Vue for the next one(s).
_Vue is making things too easy..._
