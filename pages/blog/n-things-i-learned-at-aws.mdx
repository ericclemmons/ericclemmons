{/**TODO Split this all out and cross-link**/}

## 1. AWS is not a Monolith

Check Blind.com and you'll see Amazon scoring lower than others:

Positive experiences at Amazon is

## 2. How to Write

"Clarity of writing is clarity of mind"?

**Insert example template**

## 3. Leadership Principles are a Double-Edged Sword

Clearly stated qualities that aren't Amazon-specific and true of leaders in most organizations.

Because the hiring & review process intentionally judge future & current candidates by these leadership principles,
they are easily weaponized against others as character traits or to win arguments.

"That's not _Customer Obsessed_."
"You're not _Thinking Big_ enough."

## 4. Working Backwards

## 5. Avoiding One-Way Doors

## 6. Every Team is Different

## 7. Understanding Constraints

Like every solution is affected by technical constraints,
employees have to deal with organizational constraints.

That is true no matter where you work, even for yourself!

This includes compensation, work-life-balance, team composition, ever-changing priorities, etc.

To be successful, you have to understand what change you can meaningfully impact –
not every need can be met with the given organizational constraints.

Some of these changes will take time – documenting, evangelizing, & championing low-priority but meaningful efforts can eventually yield results.
Worst-case scenario, you've documented a problem space well, generated proposals for others to eventually lead, and have a larger holistic understanding of the world around you.

Other constraints can significantly impact product capabilities and, ultimately, customer experience.
_(For example, I personally believe Cognito is wildly under-featured/funded compared to the competitive landscape)_

It's in everyone's best interest to identify & fully understand both your personal career constraints & business constraints early.

This will establish the runway for the product to successfully take-off.
Or, for your career to.

## 8. Learning to be Content

I've always struggled with being content – simply _being happy_ without having to perpetually chase a goal in persuit of happiness.

This year, I finally asked my doctor about anxiety and _I scored off-the-charts_.
Now I'm on light medication so the valleys aren't as deep, and my family has validated this improvement.

Couple that with a little trick I heard to start each day with:

> We often start the the day with obligations:
> "Today, I **have to** ..."
>
> Instead, start the dday with _opportunities_:
> "Today, I **get** to ..."

For me, these morning affirmations helped me appreciate what I _could_ control (vs. being anxious or annoyed by what was outside my control):

- Today, I get to **work remote**.
- Today, I get to **walk my kids to school**.
- Today, I get to **get paid to work on open-source**.
- Today, I get to **demo this cool DX improvement to the team**.

Sure, there is still the _"Today, I **have to** be on-call"_, but it's a balanced diet.
You still have to eat your vegatables :)
