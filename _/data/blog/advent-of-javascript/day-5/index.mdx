Challenge #5 is selecting episode checkboxes from a podcast.
The catch is that _Shift-Clicking_ a checkbox will select all the checkboxes between the first and the last selected checkbox:

With the project files downloaded and `codesandbox`'d into [a live CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-5-3ll65?file=/index.html), I'm ready to get going!

## User Requirements

Again, let's start with the _User Requirements_ and speculate how I can solve these:

> - See the list of podcast episodes

There's a provided `app.js` with `episodes` defined. The static HTML only has 10 `<li>`s, so I'll already need to templatize these.

I've been using Vue a _bunch_, so let's mix things up a bit by using [`htm`](https://github.com/developit/htm).

> - Check one episode, shift-click to select all the episodes in between

On the surface, this seems straightfward:

1. `onClick`, check if `Shift` is pressed.
1. If so, select all the episodes in between.

The UX question I have is _what if a checkbox is checked, then focus goes elsewhere_?
In this case, does <kbd>Shift+Click</kbd> **always** select the boxes in-between?

The video explicitly states:

> Track that first one, track the ending one, then checkbox all the ones in-between.

## Wiring It Up

### `htm`

First, I need to make sure `app.js` is treated as an ES Module so I can use `import` within it:

```html
<script src="app.js" type="module"></script>
```

Then, I can move `episodes` to it's own file and `import` `htm` already bound to `preact`:

```js
import {
  html,
  Component,
  render,
} from 'https://unpkg.com/htm/preact/standalone.module.js'

import { episodes } from './episodes.js'
```

Rendering looks _very similar to React_:

```js
render(
  html`<${App} episodes=${episodes} />`,
  document.querySelector('.wrapper')
)
```

Now to make this static content _dynamic_!

### Components

Normally the 1st thing I do when I'm making a template _React_-ive (heh)
is put the **entire** static markup into `App`'s `render` method.

Then, the moment I want to loop over data (e.g. `episodes.map`),
there's an opportunity for a new component.

From there, any other components (e.g. `Header`, `Footer`, `Nav`) are abstractions
to simplify the mental overhead of reading `App`.

### Interpolation

What's pretty amazing about `htm` is how natural it is coming from React.

#### Static Markup

```html
<ul class="episodes">
  <li>
    <label for="episode-1">
      <input type="checkbox" name="episode-1" id="episode-1" />
      <span>1 || Trailer</span>
    </label>
  </li>
  ...
</ul>
```

#### Dynamic Markup

Wow, this _just worked_! ðŸ”¥

```html
<ul class="episodes">
  ${episodes.map(({ id, name }) => html`
  <li>
    <label for="episode-${id}">
      <input type="checkbox" name="episode-${id}" id="episode-${id}" />
      <span>${id} || ${name}</span>
    </label>
  </li>
  `)}
</ul>
```

### Tracking `checked`

Since `htm` is managing the HTML, that naturally means that `checked` will _also_ be managed via local state.

When `onClick` is fired, I'll check the following:

- `event.shiftKey === true`
- Pull `id` from the `data-id` attribute (so I don't have to do string splitting on `id` or `name`)
- Set `lastChecked` and the updated `checked` object with this value toggled

### Bugs

For whatever reason, `checked = { [id]: true, ... }` doesn't seem to be updating immediately, _but one render later_:

<video controls>
  <source src="/static/images/preact-bug.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

I'm not sure what this bug is, but I generally make a rule of **spend 30 minutes on something and, if you stop making progress, find another way**.

### Back to Vue

I'm going to try Vue again, since it's worked so well in the previous examples.

Most likely, **there's a bug _I_ introduced**. But, it can sometimes be helpful to solve a problem _another way_, identify similarities, and **make progress**.

[I forked the CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/advent-of-js-day-5-vue-gc22m) and ready to start over ðŸ™ƒ

Luckily, it's pretty straightforward to get the same result with Vue:

```html
<ul class="episodes">
  <li v-for="episode in episodes">
    <label :for="'episode-' + episode.id">
      <input
        @click="toggleEpisode(episode, $event)"
        :id="'episode-' + episode.id"
        :checked="episode.checked"
        :name="'episode-' + episode.id"
        type="checkbox"
      />
      <span>{{ episode.id }} || {{ episode.name }}</span>
    </label>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```js
methods: {
  toggleEpisode(episode, event) {
    episode.checked = !episode.checked;

    if (episode.checked && event.shiftKey) {
      const { episodes, lastChecked = episode } = this;
      const [start, end] = [
        episodes.indexOf(lastChecked),
        episodes.indexOf(episode)
      ].sort();

      episodes.forEach((episode, i) => {
        if (i >= start && i <= end) {
          episode.checked = true;
        }
      });
    }

    this.lastChecked = episode;
  }
}
```

## Finishing Up

I learned that **`@click.prevent` actually breaks the `checked` behavior!**

This means it **wasn't** a bug in `htm` as expected, but a browser quirk!

I went back to my `htm` sandbox, **removed `event.preventDefault()`**, and was able to get it working.

When comparing the two, Vue was still easiest to get working from a static template.

I can see this being my default framework of choice for these challenges ðŸ’ª
